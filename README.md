Hi, I'm Josh Zushi!

I studied pre-med in my undergrad and worked at a hospital for several years but ended up getting my degree in Exercise Science. After a lot of trial and error, I found myself in the tech world. 

I currently work at MX as a data analyst.

My hobbies include spending time with family and friends, reading, mountain biking, and working on never ending house projects.

I am currently learning Python, front-end development, and continually improving my skills in R and SQL.

I am most interested in areas related to health and fitness, sports, finance, and everyday activities.
